# Portfolio - Sam Malang

This project is a portfolio of the  work I have created within the last 3 years of being at DMU University studying Computer Science. The content included on this site contains work from three different final year modules. Front-end, Computer Ethics and the Final Year Software Project.

## The Vision

I wanted the portfolio to be modern with minimalist touch. The idea of optimal functionality at itâ€™s core was imperative. Originally the website was going to be made up of six different pages but I changed this in the final product. I felt that single page system would be better as it was better suited to my overall vision. The website is intended to be compatible with all web browsers. The site is fully responsive designed first for mobile in mind then adapted for a normal experience. 

## Initial Development 

This section shows the initial ideas I had for the project in the form of Photoshop Mock-ups. I choose Photoshop to make the mock-ups as I am very familiar with the program. Therefore, it was easier for me to build my vision using tools I had knowledge of so time would not be wasted.

 Before I created the mockups I looked at existing portfolio sites so that I could get an idea of the direction I wanted to take. I found that most portfolio sites were easy on the eyes, meaning that I had to develop a site that would be visually engaging.


### Photoshop Mockups

1. Home Page - The Homepage design is simple as it features a the traditional website elements such as a navigation bar and footer. The main feature being the slide show.

2. About Page - The About page design had content related to me the creator such as a bio and a picture.

3. Contact Page - The Contact page featured social media links and a map, as I wanted to keep it short and sweet.

4. Backtrack Page - The BacTrack page would feature a red theme and the designs I created for that project module. 

5. Logo Page - The Logo page would document that idea behind the main site logo. 

6. HIVE Page - The hive page would feature a yellow them and the designs I created for that project module.

1. Home Section - The Home section just features the main logo. 
2. Portfolio Page - The Portfolio page only has 6 boxes at this stage I had no plans to add anymore.
3. About Page - The about page was initially just a picture and minimal text.
4. Contact Page - The Contact page at this stage had no content.


### Finished Site

1. Top - The top page features include a slide show with the navigation bar at the top. I also decided to add in a button for the area below the slide show.

2. Logo - This page features the logo and site title that both have animations. I felt it was important to add them as the site would feel alive. The text below explains the website and the motivations for it.

3. Portfolio - The Portfolio section is contains 6 boxes. It was very important for the other two projects to be the only colors on the site that stand out. This is so viewers will be drawn to them.

4. BACTrack/HIVE - The BacTrack and HIVE areas of the portfolio are in the colors the branding is presented as. This is so each area is more personalized than the rest of the site.

5. Video - The Video section contains an MP4 file that shows the images on the site being created.

6. About - The About section features two animations one for the skills graphics that moves side to side. The download button for the Resume  flashes so the attention of the viewer is captured.

7. Contact - The contact page contains a map centered on DMU. Social Media links are available next to the site logo that has an animation. The final part is the address of the map to the right.  

The final version of the site has met and exceeded all of my expectations. The sleek minimalist design of the site came to fruition better than expected. I wanted the site to have an all white background with the only colors on the page the actual BacTrack and HIVE content. This is so the viewers eyes are drawn to the colors more as they are commissioned projects in a way. The development process was enjoyable and I learned allot about HTML, JavaScript and CSS incorporating all three into the site. 

The best part about the site I feel would be the navigation as the code makes the site possible by making an enjoyable. The main thing I have taken from this project is the ability imagine an element and create it using what I have learnt. An example of this would be the arrow button under the slideshow, it was not created until I noticed that the site was missing something after uploading the final commit. By being able to take a step back and create the button relatively quickly due to the knowledge I now have was extremely satisfying.

## Testing
The portfolio site was tested using a combination of online validators and actual user testing.

### HTML and CSS Validator 

The Index.html validates with no issues. 
The styles.css validates with no issues
The bootstrap and Font-Awesome css files have errors however that is out of my control and expected. 

### User Testing

User testing was undertaken by Albert Moody and Joshua Crooks. They tested both the normal and mobile versions of the site to try and fine any errors

Albert Moody - Commented that the website had no problems with both the normal and mobile version.

Josh Crooks - Commented that the animation for the logo bellow the slideshow should play more than once. So that the user would see it while they ready the text bellow it. I went back with this information and changed the animations to his specification


## Issues and Problems Solved

Animations - Forgot how to use them untill i went back through the labs on blackbaord.

DIV Tags - Had to spend time closing all the open divs within the HTML code.

Google Maps API - Took me longer than expected to impement for some reason.
