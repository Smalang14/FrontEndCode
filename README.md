#CTEC3905-2017-Y Front-End Web Development


Modulamin Sam Malang - P14152187
# Portfolio - Sam Malang

This project is intended to showcase the design work I have created within the last 3 years of being at DMU University studying Computer Science.The content included on this site contains work from three different final year modules. Front-end, Computer Ethics and Final Year Software Project.

## The Vision

I wanted the portfolio to be modern with minimalist touch. The idea of optimal functionality at itâ€™s core was imperative. Originally the website was going to be made up of six different pages but I changed this in the final product. I felt that single page system would be better as it was better suited to my overall vision. The website is intended to be compatible with all web browsers. The site is fully responsive designed first for mobile in mind then adapted for a normal experience. 

## Intial Devlopment 

This section shows the initial ideas I had for the project in the form of Photoshop Mock-ups. I choose Photoshop to make the mock-ups as I am very familiar with the program. Therefore, it was easier for me to build my vision using tools i had knowledge of so time would not be wasted.

 Before I created the mockups i looked at existing portfolio sites so that I could get an idea of the direction I wanted to take. I found that most portfolio sites were easy on the eyes, meaning that I had to develop a site that would be visually engaging.

1. Home Page - The Homepage design is simple as it features a the traditonal website elements such as a navigation bar and footer. The main feature being the slide show.

2. About Page - The About page design had content realated to me the creator such as a bio and a picture.
3. Contact Page - The Contact page featured social media links and a map, as i wanted to keep it short and sweet.
4. BACTrack Page - The BacTrack page would feature a red theme and the designs i created for that project module. 
5. Logo Page - The Logo page would document that idea behind the main site logo. 
6. HIVE Page - The hive page would feature a yellow them and the designs i created for that project module.
